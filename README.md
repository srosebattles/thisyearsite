#Recreate a site
This assignment is to recreate the website [Make This Year](http://makethisyear.com/) from scratch.

We are allowed to take some liberties with the content. . . so I will.

Issues that I know for sure are still issues in TryThree- generally, margins and spacing. Most visually significant margin/spacing/alignment issue is
with the unordered lists, which are not as far left as the text.

I also still did not do much with resizing/media inqueries, although this is something it is important for me to practice and learn more about
because it is necessary to provide a good user experience on real websites.
